	<h1>  Task List Evaluation/ Reflections</h1>

	<ol>
		<h4> <li> Jeff wants to create an account.</li> </h4>
        <ul> 
            <li> I was successfully able to create an account on the frontend. If the website wants a fully done account creation functionality,
                there needs to be some backend services or possibly a database. </li> <br>

            <li> Currently for creating an account, the user fills out his/her information and then clicks "submit" and is directed to the
                HIPAA terms and conditions page to accept the agreement. I was not able to code in JavaScript to display the placeholder account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff wants to access his medical condition information. </li> </h4> 
        <ul>
            <li> I was able to successfully include all the medical information provided on the website. The only thing Jeff has to do is click on the
                health conditions tab to view the desired health information. </li> 
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff would like local and non-local resources to be available. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> I had no trouble including both pages for local and non-local resources. The prototype I used did not include any additional data for me to
                 provide detailed information, but the pages are present for future execution. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff would like to be able to cancel and reschedule his doctor's appointments and reminders. </li> </h4>
        <ul> 
            <li> I had no trouble or difficulties conducting this task. Jeff would need to click on the
                the reminder dropdown list in the navigation bar and select 'Doctor Appointment'.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff would like to completely remove doctor's appointments and reminders. </li> </h4>
        <ul> 
            <li> This can be done after Jeff logs in and clicks the reminders dropdown 
                list in the navigation bar and selecting 'Doctor Appointment'.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff would like to add/edit/remove his prescription reminders. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> The functionality to add/edit/remove prescription reminders is displayed on the medication page. To access this he must be logged in. 
                Then Jeff can navigate to the reminders dropdown list in the navigation bar and select 'Medication Refill'.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff wants to add/edit/remove a doctor to his user profile. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> I had no difficulties creating a 'Primary Care Physician page.' I have included a page to allow Jeff to add and edit his primary care physician. 
                The page is located in his user profile under 'Primary Care Physician'.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff would like to add/edit/remove his insurance information. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> I had a little bit of a difficulty creating this page, I have the page created, but I was not able to apply JavaScript 
                to make the insurance card appear once you click 'Upload Image' based on the prototypes example. </li> <br>

            <li> Jeff is able to access and edit his insurance information by 
                logging into his profile and selecting the 'Medical Insurance Information' button.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Jeff would like to add/edit/remove his emergency contact information. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> No difficulties creating this page in HTML and CSS. Jeff can view and edit his emergency contact information 
                by logging into his profile and selecting 'Emergency Contact Information'.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Grace wants information about local affordable healthcare. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> I was able to conduct a local and non-local resource link in the 'Resources' dropdown list. At the moment, 
                there was no data provided by the prototype 
                that explicitly states it is for affordable healthcare, but this function can be added easily to the resources section in the future. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Grace wants information about HIPAA. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> I would gladly like to navigate Grace to information about HIPAA, but the prototype provided a HIPAA agreement section 
                when a new user is creating an account. There is currently no direct link
                 to view HIPAA regulations and standards. For now, Henry will have to navigate to an external site to view this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> <li> Grace wants to add or edit her allergy information. </li> </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Grace can access and edit her allergy information by logging in and selecting the 'Allergies Information'
                 button on her profile page. </li>
        </ul>
