 	<h3> About Me </h3>

 	<img src = "images/zach.jpg">


 	<p>  I am a student with very high standards for myself, I'm from Scottsdale, Arizona and have lived in GA for 6 years. I came to <a href = "https://www.mercer.edu/"target ="_blank">Mercer University</a> on a football scholarship with big goals for my future. I found a passion and strong curiosity in technology in my last year of highschool and at the point I'm at right now. I will be studying Software Application Development and Human- Computer Interaction. Thanks for reading!
