<h1> Barcelona's Architect</h1>
<p> Antonio Gaudi's incredible buildings bring millions of tourists to Barcelona each year.</p>

<p> Gaudi's non-conformity, already visible in his teenage years, couopled with his quiet but firm devotion to the church,
made a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas.
His search for simplicity, based on his careful observations of nature, is quite apparent in his work,
from the <a href= "#park-guell">Park Guell</a> and its incredible sculptures and mosaics,
to the Church of the Sarcred Family and its organic, bulbous towers.
<h2 lang="en">La Sagrada Familia</h2>

The complicatedly named and curiously unfinished masterpiece that is the Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Family is the most visited building in Barcelona.
In it, Gaudi combines his vision of nature and architecture with his devotion to his faith.
The Sagrada Familia attracts even the non-religious to its doors in large part due to its tragic story and its still unfinished state,
of which the everpresent scaffolding and cranes are permanent reminderes. </p>
